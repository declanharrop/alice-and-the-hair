              Absolutely love my hair. Alice was very reassuring and gave me the
              confidence to go ahead and chop it off! So pleased with the
              excellent cut and canâ€™t wait now to start my colour journey! Thank
              you.

              I absolutely love having my hair done by Alice. She is such a
              lovely person and definitely the best hairdresser in the business.
              Alice and her team are so good at what they do. She colours and
              cuts my hair just how I like it and I always feel pampered and
              relaxed throughout. I have even started bringing my young daughter
              for her hair cuts now too. My daughter loves Alice and always
              looks forward to seeing her. Would definitely recommend!
